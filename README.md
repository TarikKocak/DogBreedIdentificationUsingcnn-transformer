Dog Breed Classification using CNN + Transformer
This project classifies dog breeds from images using a hybrid deep learning approach that combines a CNN (Xception) feature extractor and a Transformer for sequence modeling. The model is trained and fine-tuned on the Stanford Dogs dataset (120 classes), achieving robust results for multi-class classification.

## üöÄ Features
