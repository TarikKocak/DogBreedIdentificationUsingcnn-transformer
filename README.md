# Dog Breed Classification using CNN + Transformer
This project classifies dog breeds from images using a hybrid deep learning approach that combines a CNN (Xception) feature extractor and a Transformer for sequence modeling. The model is trained and fine-tuned on the Stanford Dogs dataset (120 classes), achieving robust results for multi-class classification.

## üöÄ Features
CNN Backbone: Xception pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction.
Transformer Layers: Captures long-range dependencies and refines feature embeddings.
Early Stopping: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss.
Input Resolution: 224x224 RGB images.
Number of Classes: 120 Dog Breeds.
Top-5 Predictions available for inference.

## üìã Architecture
Feature Extraction:
Xception Model (without final classification layers).

Feature Sequences:
Output from CNN reshaped as a sequence.

Transformer Encoder:
Processes the feature sequence.

Classification Head:
Final linear layers for predicting 120 dog breeds.

## üêï Dataset
Source: Stanford Dogs Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)

Classes: 120 Dog Breeds

Training/Validation/Test Split:
Total Images: 20,580 (combined from both the train and test folders of the dataset, shuffled, and split into 10 equal parts)

Training Set: 7 parts (7 √ó 2,058) = 14,406 images

Validation Set: 1 part (2,058 images)

Test Set: 2 parts (2 √ó 2,058) = 4,116 images

Input Image Size: 224√ó224 pixels

Labeling:
labels_r dictionary maps integer labels (0‚Äì119) to breed names.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Training Details

Model Backbone: Xception

Transformer Layers: Self-attention + Feedforward

Optimizer: AdamW

Learning Rate: Tuned using RandomizedSearchCV (initial LR ~1e-4).

Early Stopping: Monitors val_loss.
